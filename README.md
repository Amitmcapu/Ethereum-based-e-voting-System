# Ethereum-based-e-voting-System
The “Ethereum Based Decentralized E-Voting System” is a blockchain-based application.
Using this authenticated users can vote for particular candidate. 
The core idea is to combine the blockchain technology with secret sharing scheme and encryption in order to realize the decentralized e-voting application without a trusted third party. 
It provides a public and transparent voting process while protecting the anonymity of voter’s identity, the privacy of data transmission and verifiability of ballots during the billing phase.

# To Install Dependencies
Step 1: Download node package[npm] manager that comes bundled with node.js.

Step 2: Download Truffle framewok that allow us to create decentralized application on Ethereum network. 
It provides tools to write smart contracts with solidity programming language.

	Command : npm install –g truffle
Step 3: Download Ganache is a personal blockchain for Ethereum development used to deploy contracts, develop applications, and run tests. It can be downloaded from truffleframework website.

Step 4: Download Metamask extension for Google Chrome browser. It allows to connect to 	the local blockchain wth our personal account.



# Steps To Create Application
Step 1 : Make a project directory and selecting the directory

	Command : mkdir votingDemo
	Command : cd votingDemo
	
Step 2 : Truffle provides boxes for faster development of decentralized applications.
         It contains other helpful modules,solidity contracts & libraries, front-end views etc.            
	Unbox truffle pet-shop box in the project.
	
             Command : truffle unbox pet-shop
	     
Step 3 :  Open Visual studio code and select the project folder for development.
