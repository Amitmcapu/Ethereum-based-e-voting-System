# Ethereum-based-e-voting-System
The “Ethereum Based Decentralized E-Voting System” is a blockchain-based application.
Using this authenticated users can vote for particular candidate. 
The core idea is to combine the blockchain technology with secret sharing scheme and encryption in order to realize the decentralized e-voting application without a trusted third party. 
It provides a public and transparent voting process while protecting the anonymity of voter’s identity, the privacy of data transmission and verifiability of ballots.
